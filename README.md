**Where in the World?**

This application is created just for fun and is meant to present a puzzle in the form of a picture
taken inside Walt Disney World in Florida.  The user tries to guess where it is.

A demo page is up at https://rickodonnell.github.io/witw/

There are a number of things [TO DO](TODO.md).  Contributions by way of pull request are welcome.
